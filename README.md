# Deep-Learning-Frameworks


## The frameworks inculdes the following topics:
#### 1. Implement and train a neural network from scratch in Python for the MNIST dataset (no PyTorch).
#### 2. Implement and train a convolution neural network from scratch in Python for the MNIST dataset (no PyTorch).
#### 3. Train a deep convolution network on a GPU with PyTorch for the CIFAR10 dataset.
#### 4. Implement a deep residual neural network for CIFAR100. 
#### 5. Natural Language Processing 
Train models to detect the sentiment of written text of the following paper http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/papers/wvSent_acl2011.pdf
#### 6. Implement generative adversarial networks
1) Train a baseline model for CIFAR10 classification
2) Train a discriminator/generator pair on CIFAR10 dataset utilizing techniques from ACGAN and Wasserstein GANs
3) Use techniques to create synthetic images maximizing class output scores or particular features as a visualization technique to understand how a CNN is working

#### 7. Semantic Segmentation

U-net based semantic segmentation model on theStanford Background Dataset.

Nine categories are included: sky, tree, road, grass, water, building, mountain, foreground, misc.
