# Deep-Learning-Frameworks

This repository is a comprehensive guide to various deep learning frameworks, focusing on practical implementations and training. Each section is dedicated to a specific aspect of deep learning, covering a range of datasets and approaches. The content is suitable for learners at all levels, from beginners to advanced practitioners.

## Topics Covered

### 1. **Neural Network Basics**
   - **MNIST Dataset**: Implement and train a basic neural network from scratch in Python. (Note: This does not use PyTorch.)

### 2. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
   - **MNIST Dataset**: Implement and train a CNN from scratch in Python. (Excludes PyTorch usage.)

### 3. **Deep Learning with PyTorch**
   - **CIFAR10 Dataset**: Train a deep convolutional network using PyTorch on a GPU.

### 4. **Advanced Neural Networks**
   - **CIFAR100 Dataset**: Implement and train a deep residual neural network.

### 5. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
   - **Sentiment Analysis**: Train models to detect sentiment in text, based on the paper [Deeply Moving: Deep Learning for Sentiment Analysis](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/papers/wvSent_acl2011.pdf).

### 6. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**
   - **CIFAR10 Classification**: Train a baseline model.
   - **Discriminator/Generator Pair Training**: Apply ACGAN and Wasserstein GAN techniques on the CIFAR10 dataset.
   - **Synthetic Image Creation**: Techniques for visualizing CNN functionality by creating images that maximize class output scores or specific features.

### 7. **Semantic Segmentation**
   - **Stanford Background Dataset**: Implement a U-net based model for semantic segmentation. Categories include sky, tree, road, grass, water, building, mountain, foreground, and misc.

### 8. **Policy Gradient Reinforcement Learning (RL)**
   - A focus on policy gradient methods in RL, with implementations and examples.
